# Introduction to computers and programming

### Introduction
### Hardware and Software
### How Computers Store Data
### How a Program Works
### Using Python


### Introduction
* Computers can be programmed
 * Designed to do any job that a program tells them to
* Program: set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task
 * Commonly referred to as Software
* Programmer: person who can design, create, and test computer programs
* Also known as software developer


### Hardware and Software
* Hardware: The physical devices that make up a computer
* Computer is a system composed of several components that all work together
* Typical major components:
* Central processing unit
* Main memory
* Secondary storage devices
* Input and output devices


### The CPU
* Central processing unit (CPU): the part of the computer that actually runs programs
* Most important component
* Without it, cannot run software
* Used to be a huge device
* Microprocessors: CPUs located on small chips

### Main Memory
* Main memory: where computer stores a program while program is running, and data used by the program Known as Random Access Memory or RAM
* CPU is able to quickly access data in RAM
* Volatile memory used for temporary storage while program is running
* Contents are erased when computer is off


### Secondary Storage Devices
* Secondary storage: can hold data for long periods of time
* Programs normally stored here and loaded to main memory when needed
* Types of secondary memory
 - Disk drive: magnetically encodes data onto a spinning circular disk
 - Solid state drive: faster than disk drive, no moving parts, stores data in solid state memory
 - Flash memory: portable, no physical disk
 - Optical devices: data encoded optically
