## Course Overview:
This course will introduce you to the wonerful world of Python programming.  We'll learn about the essential elements of programming and how to construct basic Python programs. We will cover expressions, variables, functions, logic, and conditionals, which are foundational concepts in computer programming. We will also teach you how to use Python modules, which enable you to benefit from the vast array of functionality that is already a part of the Python language. These concepts and skills will help you to begin to think like a computer programmer and to understand how to go about writing Python programs by developing applications.

At the completion of this course, you will be able to write short Python programs that are able to accomplish real, practical tasks and complex programs that can solve huge mathematical problems as well. This course is the foundation for building expertise in Python programming. It provides the necessary building blocks for you to succeed at learning to write more complex Python programs. You will also be able to learn further skills that mostly achieved by using python programming language such as Artificial Intelligence, data analysis, big data, image processing and many more.
